# Chaining Commands


## Chaining with semicolons
Chained **/challenge/pwn** and **/challenge/college** with a semicolon as directed.

Flag: `pwn.college{42bT4ci00kJnIdV1VHDR8e6VFdQ.dVTN4QDL0QjN0czW}`


## Your First Shell Script
Created the required shell script, chained the command as previously and ran it to get the flag.

Flag: `pwn.college{IZNwi3YRAuD178jthyVkNJ1RhJR.dFzN4QDL0QjN0czW}`


## Redirecting Shell Output
First, I created the shell script, then made it executable. Then I ran the script and used **|** to pipe its output to **/challenge/solve**.

Flag: `pwn.college{kevdaE6RaeDahotXHkGupr4m-S4.dhTM5QDL0QjN0czW}`


## Executable Shell Scripts
I created the script just as before. Then I used the relative path to run the script without invoking bash.
